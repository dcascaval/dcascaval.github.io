A Lineage-Based Referencing DSL for Computer-Aided Design

Open `index.html` in any browser (we have tested Chrome and Firefox) to run the system. If making edits to the program, use `Cmd`+`s` or `Ctrl`+`s` to rerun the edited code. Logs are printed in the browser console, and tracked errors are caught and reported as a red pop-up. Full documentation of the language's facilities are in `language-docs.md`.

Example programs can be accessed in the dropdown menu in the interface, or in the `dist-programs/` folder contained here. User study referencing scenarios are given with the prefix `us-`, with `us-read-` denoting programs that users were asked to interpret, and `us-write-` denoting programs where users were asked to author queries.

If running benchmarks, the page will have to be reloaded to begin using the system again.
